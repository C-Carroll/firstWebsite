                The smell of these oysters from across the room alone will leave your mouth watering.<br>
                These oysters are buttery with a hint of spice and covered in cheese. What more could you want?!

                New Orleans BBQ Shrimp will always be one of my favorites, hands down. Though my family has seen making
                it as a <br>
                curse in the past due to strange circumstances of people ending up in the hospital, that never stopped
                us from loving this dish!

            <p>
                Shrimp Creole was a dish I could not stop asking for as a kid, its simple and flavorful. This recipe
                here was created by Chef Emeril Lagasse,<br>
                who got his start cooking for Commanders Palace, the same place that created the <a
                    href="#bbqShrimp">BBQ Shrimp</a> recipe.

            <p>
                Jambalaya is a staple food of any Louisiana get together. The best way I know how to describe it is like
                a cajun version of fried rice.<br>
                Mother's is an outstanding and distinguished resteraunt in New Orleans. Everybody in NOLA knows of
                Mother's. <br>
                The recipe is half way down the linked page, y'all can thank me later.

            <p>
                Anything goes with remoulade, and shrimp is no exception. This simple dish is agreat for a hot day when you want to bite into something fresh. <br>
                The recipe here was provided by the great Galatoire's themself.
